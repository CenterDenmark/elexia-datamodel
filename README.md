# Introduction

This repo contains the data model to be used in the Elexia project. In the current state the model is defined as an ontology in turtle format and partly as a physical model in [data_model](data_model.md)

## Physical data model

The physical data model is visualized [here](data_model.md) and documentation is exists [here](documentation.md). For a guide on how to add data to the different datasets please refer to [guide.md](guide.md).

## Ontology
To work with and edit the ontology, several tools exist amongst which are:

- [Proptege](https://protege.stanford.edu/), which is open source
- [TopBraid Composer](https://archive.topquadrant.com/products/topbraid-composer/).
