This documentation describes the physical datasets of the data model, including the purpose and structure of each entity, relationships, and specific guidelines for defining properties and units of measure. This is intended for sharing on GitHub and provides complete details for all entities.

## How to Read the Data Model

- **Entities**: Each entity (e.g., `Building`, `Device`, `Observation`) represents a distinct type of object with specific attributes.

- **Relationships**:

  - All relationships (except those involving `PropertyValue` and `PropertyValueInterval`) are stored in a dedicated `Relations` table. Each row in the `Relations` table specifies:

    - `entityFrom`: The UUID of the source entity.
    - `entity_classFrom`: The type of the source entity (e.g., `Building`, `Device`).
    - `entityTo`: The UUID of the target entity.
    - `entity_classTo`: The type of the target entity (e.g., `BuildingSpace`, `Observation`).
    - `type`: The type of relationship (e.g., `contains`, `owns`).

  - Relationships are illustrated in Crow's Foot notation in diagrams to indicate whether a relationship is mandatory or optional.

  Example of a `Relations` entry:

  ```
  {
  "entityFrom": "Building123", "entity_classFrom": "Building"
  "entityTo": "Space456", "entity_classTo": "BuildingSpace"
  "type": "hasSpace"
  }
  ```

- **Timestamps**: All timestamps follow the XSD datetime standard (ISO8601 format).

- **Attributes**: Each entity's attributes are described below, with references where applicable.
- **Ids**: All id columns should contain UUID to ensure uniqueness in values.
- **Primary keys**: For all non-timeseries datasets the primary key of the dataset consists of ["id","dateModified"]. This is because updates are appended as described in (#api-reference).

## Clarifications for Properties and Units of Measure

### Property

A `Property` represents a measurable or observable attribute, such as temperature, humidity, or energy consumption.

## API Reference

For interacting with the data model, it is reccomended to use the tranformation endpoints, but each entity also has its own base endpoint for direct interaction. Use this diagram as reference:

![d1](/res/API_interaction_diagram.drawio.png)

- For guide on how to add data, please refer to [this guide](/guides/data%20provider/transformation_endpoints_guide.md) 
- For more info on how base endpoints work, refer to [this guide](/guides/base_endpoints_guide.md)

**Swagger Documentation**: 
  
  - [Base Endpoints](https://api.centerdenmark.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
  - [Transformation Endpoints](https://transform.centerdenmark.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/)

**Portal**: [User interface for API](https://portal.centerdenmark.com/)

An API for mapping between existing ids and data lake ids is being developed [here](https://transform.centerdenmark.com/swagger-ui/index.html). This api also allows posting complex json objects such that the user does not need to post individual entities to each table.

## MQTT Reference (WIP)

*At time of writing, the MQTT broker is still being tested and is not yet available for public use.*

MQTT is only for timeseries data (PropertyValue).

The mqtt broker for the project can be connected to on the following address:

```bash
mqtt://mqtt.centerdenmark.com:8883
```

Authentication is required and uses token-based credentials integrated with the Center Denmark portal:
 * Username: The token ID
 * Password: The token itself

The token can be generated in the [portal](https://portal.centerdenmark.com/en-US/tokens). \
You can find a guide [here](https://portal.centerdenmark.com/en-US/help/token-management/token-creation).

The topic should ideally be:
```bash
{PropertyValueDatasetId}/{OrganisationId}/{BuildingId}/{BuildingSpaceId}/{DeviceId}/{PropertyId}
```

If this is not possible, please reach out to Center Denmark for assistance.
